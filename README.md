# Big data project - University of Liege
In this project we were asked to answer if the University of liege
is a good example in terms of electrical consumption.
## Data
To answer that questions a dataset about the consumption in the university is
required. As our data in confidential, if you want to recreate this project 
you will need data from other sources. In our case the dataset 
was provided by the University.

### Initial data
Initial data consisted in the energetic values generated in the University in
 the range between January and October in 2018.
 
## Pre-processing
In order to do the pre-processing correctly, we have to introduce the concept
 of Input and Output path for each task in this section.
##### \> From .xls to .csv
**Input path:** Folder where .xls are stored in a monthly folder structure (1 
folder per month and inside files .xls of that month)
    
**Ouput path:** Folder where .csv will be stored with the same folder 
structure as the input (1 folder per month)


##### \> Group total consumption per building
##### \> Plots of the year
